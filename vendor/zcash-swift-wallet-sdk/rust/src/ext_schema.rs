//! The SDK's extension tables in the wallet database.
//!
//! Tables this SDK stores alongside `zcash_client_sqlite`'s own schema follow the wallet
//! database's extension contract (see `WalletMigrator::with_external_migrations`): every
//! name carries the `ext_zcashlc_` prefix (the wallet promises never to use `ext_`), and
//! the schema is created and evolved exclusively by the [`schemerz`] migrations registered
//! here — never ad hoc at call time — so extension tables share the wallet database's
//! schema versioning. Runtime writes go through
//! [`WalletDb::transactionally_with_extension`], whose authorizer confines them to the
//! `ext_` namespace.
//!
//! [`zcashlc_init_data_database`](crate::zcashlc_init_data_database) applies these
//! migrations alongside the wallet's own; every other entry point may assume the tables
//! exist, because the platform initializes the database before using it (the Swift
//! `Initializer` does this at startup).

/// # Retired migrations

/// `AddInvalidTransferMarksTable` (id `0e1fd980-5cad-41c5-a6db-183dab527dcc` — reserved
/// forever, never reuse it) created `ext_zcashlc_orchard_ironwood_migration_invalid_marks`,
/// the side table that recorded terminal pool-migration rejection classifications back when
/// the engine had no failure states. The engine now records rejection testimony and adjudicates
/// it through the sqlite satisfiability oracle, so the migration is no longer registered: fresh
/// wallets never create the table, and `crate::migration::migrate_legacy_invalid_marks` replays
/// surviving rejection rows as reports before dropping it. Removing the registration is
/// safe because `schemerz`'s `Migrator::up` walks REGISTERED migrations only and checks
/// each against the applied set — a recorded id it no longer knows is simply never
/// consulted, so wallets that already ran the migration keep its inert row in the
/// migrations table and are otherwise unaffected.
